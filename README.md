## Usage

### Building the book

If you'd like to develop and/or build the crabook book, you should:

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` (it is recommended you do this within a virtual environment)
3. (Optional) Edit the books source files located in the `crabook/` directory
4. Run `jupyter-book clean crabook/` to remove any existing builds
5. Run `jupyter-book build crabook/`

A fully-rendered HTML version of the book will be built in `crabook/_build/html/`.

### Hosting the book

This book is not hosted anywhere yet and exists only when it is built locally. We will update here when it is published.
