## Required expertise

In order to carry out a risk assessment, your team will need to be able to do technical and non-technical tasks and should ideally comprise the expertise mentioned in the table below.
Note that one person can cover more than one type of role.

:::{list-table}
:header-rows: 1

* - Task
  - Description
  - Importance
  - Comment
* - **Framework assessment**
  - Knowledge on the governance, stakeholders, objectives and general understanding of the climate risk in the region.
    This is needed for the application of the framework as a first step of the CRA. 
  - Required
  - It may well be that this is done by several persons since it requires a broad range of expertise, but it would make things easier if the person in charge has background knowledge of the issues.
    See our [Framework](../CRA_steps/framework.md) pages for examples of the guiding questions.
* - **Climate hazards**
  - Persons with knowledge of the hazards that are involved, e.g. hydrologists, meteorologists, biologists, climatologists, environmental scientists.
  - Required
  - The level and type of expertise will depend on the risks that you will analyse in detail, but a knowledge of the subject is necessary.
* - **Climate risk assessment**
  - Persons with experience in climate risk assessments.
    The climate risk assessment requires you to combine climate hazard with vulnerability and exposure data.
  - Not required, but very helpful
  - This can be the same persons as the hazard domain experts.
* - **Data handling**
  - Persons with knowledge how to handle datasets, on different levels, both local and global.
    Knowledge of GIS and how to handle datasets in different projections.
  - Helpful
  - The workflows require the use of global and local data.
    The data handling is described within the workflows, but there might be need to further process the data.
* - **Programming/ software engineering**
  - Persons with data analysis skills that can modify and write scripts in the Python programming language.
    The workflows need to be modified, and these modifications are possible with modest programming skills.
  - Not required, but very helpful
  - There are not a lot of skills necessary to modify existing workflows.
    If a completely new workflow needs to be developed, then a software engineer is needed.
    Project members can also assist in developing new workflows, but this will not be the fastest approach.
