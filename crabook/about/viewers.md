European map viewer
=======================

This map viewer is an exploratory tool that illustrates a selection of natural hazard datasets for
both current and future climate conditions.
This information can be used for a first understanding of the level of risk in your area of interest.

While the map viewer aims to provide initial insights on the current and future climatic changes,
it is important to consider additional climate variables relevant for your region.
Next to this viewer, the Copernicus Climate Change Service and the IPCC WGI Interactive Atlas
allow the exploration of multiple climate information datasets.
