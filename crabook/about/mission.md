# EU Mission: Adaptation to Climate Change

Climate change affects regions, sectors of the economy and members of society in many ways, and EU regions and cities have different climate vulnerabilities and levels of preparedness.
Adapting to climate change means taking action to prepare for and adjust to both the current effects of climate change and the predicted impacts of the future.

The [EU Mission on Adaptation to Climate Change](https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/funding/funding-opportunities/funding-programmes-and-open-calls/horizon-europe/eu-missions-horizon-europe/adaptation-climate-change_en#what-are-the-eu-missions) empowers European regions and local authorities to achieve climate resilience, aiming to guide at least **150 communities** through understanding climate risks, developing pathways for preparation, and implementing innovative solutions by **2030**.
