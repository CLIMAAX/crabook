# Contribute to risk recipes

We are happy to receive contributions that enhance and expand the capabilities of our risk assessment toolbox. I you want to contribute, you can get in touch with us via the [CLIMAAX organization](https://github.com/CLIMAAX/) on GitHub, where this handbook and the contained [risk workflows](../CRA_steps/analysis/workflows) are at home.

If you do not have a GitHub account, you can sign up [here](https://github.com/signup).


## Workflow for existing hazard

On GitHub, you can create an [**issue**](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue) or a [**pull request**](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request), depending on the type of your contribution:

:::{card} {octicon}`issue-opened` Issue

Create an issue for questions about workflows and data used in the workflows, feature proposals and for discussion of ideas and problems related to workflows.
:::

:::{card} {octicon}`git-pull-request` Pull request

Create a pull request to contribute a new workflow, additions to an existing workflow or to send us a bug fix for a problem in a workflow.

Pull requests represent a proposal to merge code into the repository. You will need some basic knowledge of git to create a pull request. See our [software resources](../resources/software) page for more information.

To create a pull request, please [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) the workflow repository first, commit your changes, push to your fork and then create a pull request in the original repository of the CLIMAAX organization.

## Workflow for new hazard

To propose a risk assessment workflow for a hazard or combination of hazards not included in our selection, please open an issue on our [handbook repository](https://github.com/CLIMAAX/crabook).

We provide a [template repository](https://github.com/CLIMAAX/workflow_template) for new workflows. Please read and follow the instructions at the top of the template's `README.md` to get started with a new repository.
