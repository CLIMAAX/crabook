# Contribute to risk recipes

We are happy to receive contributions that enhance and expand the capabilities of our risk assessment toolbox. I you want to contribute, you can get in touch with us via the [CLIMAAX organization](https://github.com/CLIMAAX/) on GitHub, where this handbook and the contained [risk workflows](../CRA_steps/analysis/workflows) are at home.

If you do not have a GitHub account, you can sign up [here](https://github.com/signup).

On GitHub, you can create an **issue** or a **pull request**, depending on the type of your contribution:

:::{card} {octicon}`issue-opened` Issue

For questions about workflows and data, feature proposals and discussion of ideas and problems.
:::

:::{card} {octicon}`git-pull-request` Pull request

For new workflows, additions to existing workflows and bug fixes.

Pull requests represent a proposal to merge code into the repository. You will need some basic knowledge of git to create a pull request. See our [coding resources](../resources/coding) page for more information.

To create a pull request, please [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) the workflow repository first, commit your changes, push to your fork and then create a pull request in the original repository of the CLIMAAX organization.
