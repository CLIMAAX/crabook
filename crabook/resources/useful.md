Useful materials and technical documentation
=======================

We might need a page with links to tutorials and documentation for technical things outside of scope of CLIMAAX.  
Things such as intro to:
- Git
- Python
- Jupyter ecosystem
- Scientific python libraries etc

For example things like this  
- [FAIR principles for data and software](https://librarycarpentry.org/lc-fair-research/)
- [Getting started with Git](https://librarycarpentry.org/lc-git/index.html)
- [Getting started with Github](https://foundations.projectpythia.org/foundations/getting-started-github.html)
- [Getting started with Python](https://foundations.projectpythia.org/foundations/getting-started-python.html#)
- [Getting started with Jupyter](https://foundations.projectpythia.org/foundations/getting-started-jupyter.html)
- [Core scientific Python libraries](https://foundations.projectpythia.org/core/overview.html)

These are just examples.  
It would be useful we craete a list of things we want to include here, then someone reviews what is out there and we put here the result.
