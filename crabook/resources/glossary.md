[Adaptive Capacity](#framework-term-adaptivecapacity)

Binder
 Referring to [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org), an open-source project in the Jupyter ecosystem that allows the creation of custom, interactive, and executable computing environments from GitHub repositories containing Jupyter notebooks. It enables users to convert Jupyter notebooks into shareable web applications that others can use without needing to install any software or dependencies locally.

[Climate Risk Management](#framework-term-crm) (CRM)

Conda environment
 A self-contained and isolated computational environment created and managed by [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/), an open-source package and environment management system.

Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX)
 A [WRCP framework](https://cordex.org/) to evaluate regional climate model performance. [CORDEX data](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/CORDEX%3A+Regional+climate+projections) can be downloaded from the Copernicus Climate Data Store.

Coupled Climate Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP)
 A [WRCP project](https://wcrp-cmip.org/) to better understand past, present and future changes in the climate based on climate modelling.

[Hazard](#framework-term-hazard)

[Priority group](#framework-term-prioritygroup)

Python
 A programming language widely used for data analysis and visualization.
 See [Python](software.md#python) in our software resources.

JupyterBook
 An open-source tool used for creating interactive, web-based books and documentation from Jupyter notebooks and markdown files. This website is generated as a [JupyterBook](https://jupyterbook.org/).

Jupyter notebook
 A document format in which combine code, narrative text, visualizations and other rich media can be combined.
 Jupyter notebooks allow for interactive execution of code and are particularly popular for exploratory data analysis and in education.
 See [Jupyter](software.md#jupyter) in our software resources.
