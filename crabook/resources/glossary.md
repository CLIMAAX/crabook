Binder
 Referring to [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org), an open-source project in the Jupyter ecosystem that allows the creation of custom, interactive, and executable computing environments from GitHub repositories containing Jupyter notebooks. It enables users to convert Jupyter notebooks into shareable web applications that others can use without needing to install any software or dependencies locally.

Conda environment
 A self-contained and isolated computational environment created and managed by [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/), an open-source package and environment management system.

CORDEX
 The **C**oordinated **R**egional Climate **D**ownscaling **Ex**periment, a [WRCP framework](https://cordex.org/) to evaluate regional climate model performance. [CORDEX data](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/CORDEX%3A+Regional+climate+projections) can be downloaded from the Copernicus Climate Data Store.

Exposure
 See [Exposure](#framework-term-exposure) in the CLIMAAX Framework.

Hazard
 See [Hazard](#framework-term-hazard) in the CLIMAAX Framework.

Python
 A programming language widely used for data analysis and visualization.
 See [Python](software.md#python) in our software resources.

JupyterBook
 An open-source tool used for creating interactive, web-based books and documentation from Jupyter notebooks and markdown files. This website is generated as a [JupyterBook](https://jupyterbook.org/).

Jupyter notebook
 A document format in which combine code, narrative text, visualizations and other rich media can be combined.
 Jupyter notebooks allow for interactive execution of code and are particularly popular for exploratory data analysis and in education.
 See [Jupyter](software.md#jupyter) in our software resources.

Response
 See [Response](#framework-term-response) in the CLIMAAX Framework.

Risk
 See [Risk](#framework-term-risk) in the CLIMAAX Framework.

RCP
 **R**epresentative **C**oncentration **P**athways are climate change scenarios for future greenhouse gas concentrations.

SSP
 **S**hared **S**ocioeconomic **P**athways are global climate change [scenarios](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/chapter-1/#1.6#1.6.1) of socioeconomic changes until the year 2100.

Vulnerability
 See [Vulnerability](#framework-term-vulnerability) in the CLIMAAX Framework.
