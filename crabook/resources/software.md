## Git and GitHub

Version control system.

- [Getting started with Git](https://librarycarpentry.org/lc-git/index.html)
- [Introduction to Git](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/vcs/vcs-git#rr-vcs-git)

We use GitHub for distribution of version-controlled code and content and maintain our repositories in the CLIMAAX organization.

## Python

Programming language and software ecosystem.

- [Getting started with Python](https://foundations.projectpythia.org/foundations/getting-started-python.html#)
- [Core scientific Python libraries](https://foundations.projectpythia.org/core/overview.html)

Python packages commonly used in the CLIMAAX risk workflows for data handling, processing and visualization:

- xarray, netcdf4, rasterio, rioxarray
- numpy, dask
- pandas, geopandas
- scipy, scikit-learn
- matplotlib, cartopy, contextily
- plotly

We recommend the conda package manager for setting up a Python environment.


## Jupyter

Interactive computing environment.

The environment specifications provided in every CLIMAAX hazard workflows repository include both the jupyter lab and notebook interfaces.
