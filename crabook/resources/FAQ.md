## First Test Category

:::::{dropdown} Do we want to use the dropdown layout as for the guiding Q&As?

Answers would look like this then. The dropdowns can also be expanded by default if we want.

Adding a second paragraph or a figure is no problem.

Or do we want to display questions with a glossary-like layout?
:   Answers would look like this in the layout with the glossary-type layout. I don't think jupyter book has support for multiple paragraphs like this, which is a drawback.

:   This has the right indentation, but the spacing doesn't look right.


### Of course, we could just use a heading for each question. Long titles might crowd the table of contents in the right margin too much though.

The advantage is that we get the option to link directly to a specific question for free, as a link anchor is created automatically by the jupyter book. But we can also always set our own anchors for the other styles (the automatically created anchors names are quite long, so we might want to do that anyway).
