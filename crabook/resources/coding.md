For example things like this

- [Getting started with Git](https://librarycarpentry.org/lc-git/index.html)
- [Getting started with Github](https://foundations.projectpythia.org/foundations/getting-started-github.html)
- [Getting started with Python](https://foundations.projectpythia.org/foundations/getting-started-python.html#)

- [Core scientific Python libraries](https://foundations.projectpythia.org/core/overview.html)

These are just examples.
It would be useful we craete a list of things we want to include here, then someone reviews what is out there and we put here the result.
