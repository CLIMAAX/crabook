# Support

Support is offered by the CLIMAAX project for climate risk assessments following the Framework and utilizing the workflows in this Handbook.

:::{admonition} Public and exclusive support
:class: note

The Handbook with the Framework description, workflows, technical documentation and supporting pages are **public** and open to everyone.
You can reach out to us with questions and [contribute](../community/contribute.md) via the Forum and GitHub, independent of your relationship with the CLIMAAX project.

The [service desk](#support-servicedesk) and [JupyterHub](#support-jupyterhub) are **exclusively** offered to our project partners and participating regions that receive financial support through the CLIMAAX project (i.e., selected regions of the CLIMAAX open calls).
:::


We recommend to always check the Handbook for information before reaching out to us.
The website is regularly updated by the CLIMAAX team and frequently asked questions added to our [FAQ](FAQ.md).
A basic search function is available in the top left under our logo or you can use your favourite search engine.

When reaching out to us, please prefer our general channels, i.e. the forum, GitHub and service desk, rather than contacting individuals from the CLIMAAX team directly via email.
This way we can process requests more efficiently and transparently.
