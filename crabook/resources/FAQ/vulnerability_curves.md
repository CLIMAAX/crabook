# Vulnerability curves

When assessing damages, next to the value of the assets it is also important to find how vulnerable an asset is to a certain hazard.
One way to do this is by identifying vulnerability curves.
These curves relate a hazard intensity to a fraction of the maximum damages that occurs under this hazard intensity.

Here, we elaborate on vulnerability curves for floods and windstorms.

For flood damages, [Huizinga et al. (2017)](https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC105688) quantified depth-damage curves across the world ({numref}`flood-curves-huizinga`).
These depth-damage curves relate the water depth during a flood event to a fraction of the building that is damaged.
This fraction is multiplied by the found [maximum damage](./maximum_damages.md) of a certain asset.
The authors have six classes of assets: residential, commercial, industrial, agriculture, transport, and infrastructure â€“ roads.

Raster-based land use data may not contain information on the distribution of damage classes within the land use class. This will then need to be estimated by the stakeholder per land-use class. These proportions can then be used to create a new depth-damage curve that considers the proportions of buildings in the land use cell. See the formula below.

```{math}
:label: curve-alteration-flood
c_{new}\left(m\right)=\ R_{c1}\ast\ c_1\left(m\right)+\ \left[\ldots\right]+\ R_{cn}\ast\ c_n\left(m\right)
```

Where: 

- $c_{new}\ (m)$ = the new curve for the land use class as a function of inundation depth
- $m$ = inundation depth
- $R_{cn}$ = ratio of class type in the specific landuse cell that should have curve n
- $c_n\ (m)$ = curve for asset type n as a function of inundation depth

For wind, the vulnerability curves are based on the construction type of a building.
Some structures are more resilient than others.
For example, wooden sheds are easier to be damaged by wind than concrete buildings.
Using the selection of [Feuerstein et al. (2011)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosres.2010.12.026) six vulnerability curves can be differentiated.

Land use data contains no information on specific building types and this needs to be estimated by the stakeholder per land use class. However, as a first estimation, the PAGER database is used by ([Koks & Haer., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-63580-w)) and a table is given here. to identify the proportion of building types per land use. These proportions can then be used to create a new curve that considers the proportions of buildings in the land use cell.

```{math}
:label: curve-alteration-wind
c_{new}\left(w\right)=\ R_{c1}\ast\ c_1\left(w\right)+\ \left[\ldots\right]+\ R_{cn}\ast\ c_n\left(w\right)
```


Where: 

- $c_{new}\ (w)$ = the new curve for the land use class as a function of windspeed
- $w$ = 3-second windgust in $m/s$
- $R_{cn}$ = ratio of class type in the specific landuse cell that should have curve n
- $c_n\ (w)$ = curve for building type n as a function of windspeed
