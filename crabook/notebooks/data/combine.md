# Combining the data

It can be a struggle to work with the data in different formats, different resolutions etc.

It would be useful to have a few notebooks with generic examples on how to work with this data together.

The examples could include:
- Finding the tools that work with all data types. 
- Getting all the data loaded using the same tool
- Getting all the data into same grid or resolution for calculating things
- Plotting different data together
