### Vulnerability data for droughts

This was just copied from droughts workflow

In this workflow, vulnerability is assessed by means of a Drought Vulnerability Index (DVI). The overall DVI is calculated as a mathematical average among the different vulnerability indicators normalized between 0 and 1. Among them we can include: 

- Population density 

- Female to male ratio 

- Poverty level 

- Agricultural occupation 

- Irrigated land 

- Soil water holding capacity 

- Food productio
