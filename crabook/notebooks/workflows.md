Risk assessment workflows 
=======================

In the initial conception of the CLIMAAX toolbox, different sample risk assessment workflows were identified and implemented.  
Each workflow follows a 'stepwiseâ€™ data processing scheme to calculate risk as a combination of hazard, exposure and vulnerability information.  

The code to compute the workflows was selected from existing research following a review process based on the following criteria: 

- Scientific research with sufficient number of citations; 
- Official EU reports; 
- Frameworks implemented in the CLIMAAX pilots. 

Other important criteria for the risk workflow selection are that  

**a)** they should be feasible to be implemented within the CLIMAAX toolbox, and  
**b)** they should be understandable and comprehensive also for users that are not trained in the technical or conceptual construction of risk assessment tools. 



Each workflow is described by first introducing the main methodological framework and components, e.g. $R=H*E*V$ or risk matrix (see {numref}`Flood risk` below). Then, the way each risk component is calculated and link to useful datasets is described. Finally, references to main papers and/or reports are included.
