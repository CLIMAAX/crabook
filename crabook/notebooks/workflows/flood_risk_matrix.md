# Flood risk matrix framework

In this workflow the risk is assessed as a combination between hazard and vulnerability (damage) defined by means of a risk matrix. Examples of risk matrices are reported below. In order to use this approach, hazard and vulnerability need to be classified in classes

For the Catalunia pilot, the information needed to assess flood riksrisk area: 

Hazard (from Inuncat, flooding emergency plan): Probability of the occurrence of a flood, in a place, in a period fixed time  

Vulnerability (from Inuncat, flooding emergency plan): The estimated degree of damage or loss of an exposed element or group of elements to the occurrence of a phenomenon of a certain magnitude and intensity.
