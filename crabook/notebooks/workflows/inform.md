# INFORM Risk assessment framework

## Damage analysis Risk framework 

### My next one

I've added some text

This workflow is based on the risk assessment framework developed by JRC within the project INFORM. This The INFORM score is calculated with a multiplicative equation where each of the dimensions is treated equally.

$Flood risk = {hazard\ \&\ exposure}^{1/3} * vulnerability^{1/3} * {lack\ of\ coping\ capacity}^{1/3}$

In this form INFORM’s score is more susceptible to Vulnerability and Lack of coping capacity, the internal forces of risk that can be most influenced by the DRR activities. The equation above resembles the risk equation, where all the factors come with the probabilistic notion. However, composite indicator methodology can afford to use proxies whenever the probabilistic presentation of the concept’s dimension is not available.

Before the construction of the composite indicator and sub-indices, all raw data values of the core indicators are pre-processed to obtain ranges from 0 to 10, in which theat higher is the worse,.  in combination with min–max normalisation. A pre-processed indicator is referred to as an index.  
{math}`z_i = (x_i – min(x)) / max(x) – min(x))`  
with: 
* {math}`z_i` = the ith normalised value, 
* {math}`x_i` = the ith value, 
* min(x) = minimum value and 
* max(x) = maximum value. 

## Examples of data that can be used to assess the flood risk with the INFORM framework are

_Hazard & Eposure_: River flood extent and water depth available from the JRC repository (https://data.jrc. ec.europa.eu/dataset/1d128b6c-a4ee-4858-9e34-6210707f3c81) for different return periods. Flood extent map of 100m resolution. 

_Vulnerability_: Gender inequality index (GII), GINI coefficient, age dependency ratio, people affected/deaths, houses lost/damaged, crops lost/damaged, roads lost/damaged, economic losses; 

_Lack of coping capacity_: Education centres, hospitals, people evacuated, corruption perception index (CPI), (International) aid contribution impact.
