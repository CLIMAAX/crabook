# Snow

In recent decades, Europe has faced numerous weather-related natural disasters, with 95% of reported events linked to hydrological, climatological, or meteorological phenomena (CRED, 2021). Snowstorms and blizzards are particularly significant, especially in northern and mountainous regions. These events are characterized by strong wind gusts, considerable precipitating or blowing snow, and reduced visibility, often resulting in widespread disruption to transportation, energy infrastructure, and economic activities (Bednar-Friedl et al., 2022).

According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 2021) projections, extreme winter storms, including snow and blizzards, may increase in intensity and impact despite a general trend toward lower snow cover with warming temperatures. These extreme events are expected to become more frequent in certain regions where cold air masses persist, particularly in areas vulnerable to rapid shifts in weather conditions ([O’Gorman, 2014](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature13625); [Zarzycki, 2018](https://doi.org/10.1029/2018GL079820)). Additionally, the combined effects of urbanization and inadequate storm preparedness will likely compound the risks of snowstorms, leading to further economic losses and potentially more significant loss of life. 

Understanding the dynamics of extreme snow and blizzards and assessing their risks is crucial for developing effective mitigation and adaptation strategies and building resilience in changing climatic conditions.
