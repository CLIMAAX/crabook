# Wind

Windstorms can cause severe damage to buildings and infrastructure, especially in areas unprepared for their powerful forces. Although future storm wind speeds in Europe may not drastically increase, shifts in storm paths toward the north are projected.

The workflows aim to help identify areas vulnerable to windstorm-related damage and high economic costs. The analysis focuses on historical storm data in the region as well as storms from southerly regions to help areas prepare for future events.

The risk assessment methodology integrates hazard, exposure, and vulnerability data to estimate potential damages from storms. By analyzing wind gust speeds, asset vulnerability, and economic value, this approach provides a clear picture of which locations are at risk and helps create spatial damage maps. These maps offer valuable insights for better planning and protection of communities and infrastructure.
