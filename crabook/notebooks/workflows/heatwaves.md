# Heatwaves

Heatwaves are prolonged periods of excessively high temperatures, often accompanied by dry conditions, that can significantly impact human health, agriculture, and ecosystems. They are typically defined based on local climate norms, with temperatures exceeding a certain threshold for an extended duration, such as several days or weeks. These extreme heat events can result in a range of adverse effects, including heat-related illnesses, increased mortality rates, wildfires, and severe droughts. Urban areas, where concrete and asphalt absorb and retain heat, are particularly vulnerable due to the urban heat island effect.

Heatwaves are becoming more frequent and severe due to climate change, making them a critical hazard in many parts of the world. They pose significant risks to public health, infrastructure, and food security. In the context of climate risk assessment, heatwaves are increasingly recognized as a major threat. Understanding the likelihood, duration, and intensity of heatwaves is essential for developing mitigation and adaptation strategies to protect vulnerable populations and reduce overall climate risks. Their growing impact highlights the importance of integrating heatwave hazard assessments into broader climate resilience planning.
