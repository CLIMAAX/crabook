The CLIMAAX project
=======================

CLIMAte risk and vulnerability Assessment framework and toolboX (CLIMAAX) is a 4-year Horizon Europe project that provides financial, analytical, and practical support to improve regional climate and emergency risk management plans. CLIMAAX is designed to contribute to the harmonization and consolidation of the practice of climate risk assessment, leaving a legacy for upcoming European initiatives while turning the European Commission Climate Change Mission on Adaptation. into practice. The project started in January 2023 and runs until December 2026.

## In a nutshell

The European landscape of disaster risk management and climate adaptation is far from uniform.

CLIMAAX builds upon existing risk assessment frameworks, methods and tools, and promotes the use of datasets and service platforms for local and regional scale deployment. It develops a robust and coordinated framework of consistent, harmonised and comparable risk assessments.

The project takes the existing tools and services beyond the state-of-the-art by prioritizing the further development of accessibility, guidance, tuning to local contexts, interpretation and uptake by representative Disaster Risk Management and Civil Protection authorities.

CLIMAAX is designed to significantly contribute to the harmonization and consolidation of the practice of climate risk assessment (CRA) by providing:  

1. A standardized CRA framework built on current community experience and best-practices.
2. A Toolbox for conducting risk analyses, which hosts data, models and utilities and provides access to European and global open data archives integrated with local data and procedures.
3. Five European pilot regional CRAs to shape the framework and toolset.
4. Financial support for at least 50 regions to execute a context specific CRA.
5. CRA guidance material and online helpdesk for other European regions.
6. A proposal to upscale results into the future operationalization of the regional CRA support function.

## Framework Description

The CLIMAAX Framework is designed to empower regions to conduct inclusive and harmonised climate risk assessments (CRAs). It translates the ambitions of the EU Mission on Adaptation towards transformational adaptation strategies that build resilience into practice by supporting the advancement and implementation of climate risk assessments.

The Framework adheres to key principles such as social justice and equity, puts participatory processes central to the process, and provides guidance on the selection of sound technical choices for conducting climate risk assessments. The framework proposes five risk assessment steps which form an iterative climate risk assessment cycle aimed at informing climate adaptation and risk management strategies.

The framework is based on established and widely assessed principles (e.g., related to governance, equity, social justice), technical choices (e.g., for parameters, climate scenarios etc.), and participatory processes (learning, communication, consultation). These three conceptual dimensions frame the climate risk assessment steps lead, through continued implementation, to information on climate risk that can support adaptation and risk management planning.

## CRA steps

The **main steps** for assessing climate risk are:

Scoping
 : The first step of the risk assessment cycle is to determine context, objectives and criteria, which are embedded in a pre-defined set of principles. This step is of key importance as it sets the ground for further steps.

Risk Identification
 : The Toolbox provides a set of workflows for multiple climate hazards (floods, drought, heatwave, fire, snow, wind). In addition to hazard information, exposure and vulnerability data are to be considered as key indicators for the risk assessment.

Risk Analysis
 : The analysis of climate risks is conducted by the Toolbox. Risk outcomes are explored, for example, by using future scenarios and probabilistic or event-based approaches. Also, further guidance is provided to the user with regard to hazard, exposure and vulnerability data as well as the selection of future scenarios.

Key Risks Assessment
 : Key risks that are particularly important to the region or in the local context are identified from the risk analysis. While key risks need to be addressed by climate risk management strategies to foster adaptation, it is important to also identify less urgent risks due to the dynamic nature of climate change that may amplify all or some of these risks.

Monitoring and Evaluation
 : Key risks, as well as less urgent risks, and the effectiveness of adaptation and risk management measures need monitoring and evaluation leading to an iterative repetition of the risk assessment cycle with new insights for the scoping step and so forth.

Regions are encouraged to iteratively carry out the steps of the climate risk assessment cycle which will lead to more comprehensive scoping, enhanced insights from adaptation action, more customized data, overall resulting in improved outputs.
