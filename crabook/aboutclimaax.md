## In a nutshell

The European landscape of disaster risk management and climate adaptation is far from uniform.

CLIMAAX builds upon existing risk assessment frameworks, methods and tools, and promotes the use of datasets and service platforms for local and regional scale deployment. It develops a robust and coordinated framework of consistent, harmonised and comparable risk assessments.

The project takes the existing tools and services beyond the state-of-the-art by prioritizing the further development of accessibility, guidance, tuning to local contexts, interpretation and uptake by representative Disaster Risk Management and Civil Protection authorities.
