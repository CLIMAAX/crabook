                <p>Since the flash flooding in 2008, the municipality has been investing in different adaptation strategies to reduce the risk in the central area of the city which is most at risk.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Meteorological observation stations were implemented to gather more accurate local information.</li>
                    <li>A huge landscape park was created to increase the retention area for heavy rainfall events. With this park and other planned activities, the city aims to become a sponge city.</li>
                    <li>Considering the exposure of roads, the city has ordered the permanent closure of one road which is heavily affected during heavy rainfall events and at risk of rockfall.</li>
