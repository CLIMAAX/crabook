# Welcome CLIMAAX Climate Risk Assessment Handbook

CLIMAte risk and vulnerability Assessment framework and toolboX (CLIMAAX) is a 4-year Horizon Europe project that will provide financial, analytical, and practical support to improve regional climate and emergency risk management plans. CLIMAAX is designed to contribute to the harmonization and consolidation of the practice of climate risk assessment, leaving a legacy for upcoming European initiatives. The project started in January 2023 and runs until December 2026.

## In a nutshell

The European landscape of disaster risk management and climate adaptation is far from uniform.

CLIMAAX builds upon existing risk assessment frameworks, methods and tools, and promotes the use of datasets and service platforms for local and regional scale deployment. It will develop a robust and coordinated framework of consistent, harmonised and comparable risk assessments.

The project brings the existing tools and services beyond state-of-the-art by prioritizing the further development of accessibility, guidance, tuning to local contexts, interpretation and uptake by representative Disaster Risk Management and Civil Protection authorities.

CLIMAAX is designed to significantly contribute to the harmonization and consolidation of the practice of climate risk assessment (CRA), leaving a substantial legacy for upcoming European initiatives. The project will deliver:

1. A standardized CRA framework CRA built on current community experience and best-practices

2. A Toolbox with data, models and utilities to provide access to European and global open data archives integrated with local data and procedures

3. Five European pilot regional CRAs to shape the framework and toolset

4. Financial support for at least 50 regions to execute a context specific CRA

5. CRA guidance material and online helpdesk for other European regions

6. A proposal to upscale results into the future operationalization of the regional CRA support function
