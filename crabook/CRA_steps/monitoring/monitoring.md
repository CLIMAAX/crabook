Monitoring and Evaluation
=======================

Key risks, as well as less urgent risks, and the effectiveness of {abbr}`CCA (Climate Change Adaptation)` and {abbr}`CRM (Climate Risk Management)` actions on key risks will need to be monitored and evaluated, which also includes an element of learning. This step generally focusses on understanding changing conditions with regard to climate risk as well as {abbr}`CRM (Climate Risk Management)`/{abbr}`CCA (Climate Change Adaptation)`. While monitoring entails tracking progress with regard to the {abbr}`CRA (Climate Risk Assessment)` process as well as {abbr}`CRM (Climate Risk Management)`/{abbr}`CCA (Climate Change Adaptation)` implementation, evaluation seeks to understand the effectiveness of CRA and {abbr}`CRM (Climate Risk Management)`/{abbr}`CCA (Climate Change Adaptation)` action. Learning entails consideration of insights gained during processing the various {abbr}`CRA (Climate Risk Assessment)` steps and it may lead to adjusting the processes particularly if basic conditions or expectations undergo change. The Monitoring and Evaluation step produces new information â€“ this can then feed into the {abbr}`CRA (Climate Risk Assessment)` cycle designed for iterative repetition with the goal of delivering new insights for the scoping step as well as additional input for and from participatory processes.
