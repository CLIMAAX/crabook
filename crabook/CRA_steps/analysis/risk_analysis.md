Risk analysis
=======================

The analysis of climate risks is conducted by the Toolbox. Risk outcomes are explored, for example, by using future scenarios and probabilistic or event-based approaches. Also, further guidance is provided to the user with regard to hazard, exposure and vulnerability data as well as the selection of future scenarios.
