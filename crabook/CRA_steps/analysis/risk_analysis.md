The climate risk analysis step introduces the operational Toolbox by applying Risk Workflows, which combine components of hazard, exposure and vulnerability to an estimate of risk. In this step available or individual data can be used to calculate hazards in the six individual risk workflows floods, droughts, heatwaves, fire, snow, and wind. Applying probabilistic or event-based approaches allows to calculate current hazards or project future hazards through a selection of future scenarios â€“ the combination with (available or individual) exposure and vulnerability data finally provides the respective quantification of climate risk. Besides facilitating practical climate risk quantification options this step will provide further guidance for the user with regard to hazard, exposure and vulnerability data or the selection of future scenarios.
