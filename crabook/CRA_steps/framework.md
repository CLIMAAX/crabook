Framework description
=======================

The CLIMAAX Framework is designed to empower regions to conduct inclusive and harmonised climate risk assessments (CRAs). It translates the ambitions of the EU Mission on Adaptation towards transformational adaptation strategies that build resilience into practice by supporting the advancement and implementation of climate risk assessments.

The Framework proposes to adhere to key principles such as social justice and equity, puts participatory processes central to the process, and provides guidance on the selection of sound technical choices for conducting climate risk assessments. The framework proposes five risk assessment steps which form an iterative climate risk assessment cycle aimed at informing climate change adaptation (CCA) and climate risk management (CRM) strategies. A full description of the advanced Framework including {abbr}`CRA (Climate Risk Assessment)` and {abbr}`CRM (Climate Risk Management)` steps can be found here (link to advanced framework will be available soon).

The framework is based on established principles (related to governance, equity and social justice), technical choices to be made (e.g., for parameters, climate scenarios etc.), and participatory processes (e.g., learning, communication, consultation). These three conceptual dimensions frame the {abbr}`CRA (Climate Risk Assessment)` steps lead, through continued implementation, to information on climate risk that can support adaptation and risk management planning.

The Framework is designed to provide a reference for defining {abbr}`CRA (Climate Risk Assessment)` workflows and their implementation that are consistent with the highest standards and best practices as well as state-of-the-art scientific findings. In particular, the Framework gives guidance on:

1. **Stakeholder engagement processes** that ensure development of appropriate {abbr}`CRA (Climate Risk Assessment)`â€™s and uptake into strategic planning.

2. **Selection of hazards** that have shown or are known to have a substantial societal impact and will be affected by climate change.

3. Use of available **data and concepts** containing meaningful information for the region or community of interest.

4. **Selection of indicators** for meteorological or hydrological hazards and societal or ecological impacts that can be used for designing and monitoring adaptation and risk management strategies.

5. Use of climate and **socio-economic scenarios** that are relevance for impacts and risks that needs to be accounted for regions and communities for adaptation/risk management strategies.
