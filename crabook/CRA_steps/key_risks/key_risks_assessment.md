Key Risks Assessment
=======================

Key risks that are particularly important to the region or in the local context can be identified from the risk analysis. Risk severity (calculated through risk workflows as the potential of adverse consequences, likelihood and duration) as well as the capacity and relevance of systems and actors to respond to risk (risk tolerance) affects the Risk Profiling and finally its classification. While key risks in general should be addressed by {abbr}`CRM (Climate Risk Management)`/{abbr}`CCA (Climate Change Adaptation)` strategies, it is important to also keep track of risks considered less urgent. Due to the dynamic nature of climate change and other drivers, these risks are likely to undergo change and be amplified.
