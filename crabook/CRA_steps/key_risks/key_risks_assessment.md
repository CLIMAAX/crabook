Key risks assessmentss
=======================

Key risks that are particularly important to the region or in the local context are identified from the risk analysis. While key risks need to be addressed by climate risk management strategies to foster adaptation, it is important to also identify less urgent risks due to the dynamic nature of climate change that may amplify all or some of these risks.
