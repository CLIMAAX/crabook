## Stakeholders, Experts, Representatives, Users

- **Stakeholders** may be identified from relevant policy areas (e.g. ministries, agencies, government and state offices, agencies) as well as from public and private sectors of interest.
- **Experts** are scientists, practitioners or policy advisors with robust knowledge on climate risks (e.g. universities, institutes, climate and meteorological services).
- **Representatives** from vulnerable or marginalized groups, exposed areas, or other relevant communities in society.
- **Users** are directly related to the (technical) use of the CLIMAAX Climate Risk Assessment Framework and Toolbox.

## Supporting Definitions

**Climate Risk Management** (CRM) includes plans, actions, strategies or policies that “reduce the likelihood and/or magnitude of adverse potential consequences, based on assessed or perceived risk” (IPCC, 2023, p. 2921). CRM has the goal of reaching resilience and adaptation. 

**Risk Outcome** refers to the result(s) of the Risk Workflow(s) as part of Risk Analysis and feeds into the Key Risk Assessment. 

**Workflows** are organized by hazard and quantify climate risk in the Risk Analysis step through the CLIMAAX Toolbox. Workflows are coded in Python and allow to be modified by users.
