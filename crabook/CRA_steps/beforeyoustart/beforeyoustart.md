- (framework-term-risk)=
  **Risk** is defined as "[t]he potential for adverse consequences for human or ecological systems, recognizing the diversity of values and objectives associated with such systems." (Reisinger et al., 2020, p. 4). It can be calculated as an interplay of climate hazards (e.g. frequency and intensity of droughts), exposure (e.g. a land area where agriculture is conducted) and vulnerability (e.g. presence or absence of irrigation) and also includes human responses (Ara Begum et al., 2022).
- (framework-term-hazard)=
  A **climate-related Hazard** is "the potential occurrence of a natural or human-induced physical event or trend that may cause loss of life, injury, or other health impacts, as well as damage and loss to property, infrastructure, livelihoods, service provision, ecosystems and environmental resource" (IPCC, 2022, p. 5) such as floods, droughts, heatwaves, and other extreme weather events. Climate change can alter the frequency, magnitude, and duration of extreme weather events which are especially relevant for a climate risk context.
- (framework-term-vulnerability)=
  **Vulnerability** is defined as "the propensity or predisposition to be adversely affected and encompasses a variety of concepts and elements, including sensitivity or susceptibility to harm and lack of capacity to cope and adapt." (IPCC, 2022, p. 5). It further includes "all relevant environmental, physical, technical, social, cultural, economic, institutional, or policy-related factors that contribute to susceptibility and/or lack of capacity to prepare, prevent, respond, cope or adapt" (UNDRR, 2022, p. 19). The Climate Risk Sourcebook (Zebisch et al., 2023, p. 19) defines the reduction of vulnerability as "one of the biggest levers" for climate risk management.
- (framework-term-exposure)=
  **Exposure** refers to "(t)he presence of people, livelihoods, species or ecosystems, environmental functions, services, and resources, infrastructure, or economic, social, or cultural assets in places and settings that could be adversely affected" (Oppenheimer et al., 2014, p. 1048).  
- (framework-term-response)=
  **Response**: In addition to hazard, exposure and vulnerability, climate risk also depends on how a society adapts to climate events. Adaptation responses (also called climate risk management interventions or options) may entail planned adaptation (physical constructions, nature based solutions, planned relocation) or autonomous adaptation (behavioral changes or forced migration). 


## Stakeholders, Experts, Priority Groups, Users

- (framework-term-stakeholder)=
  **Stakeholders** from policy (e.g. ministries, agencies, government and state offices, agencies), relevant public and private sectors.
- (framework-term-expert)=
  **Experts** are scientists, practitioners or policy advisors with robust knowledge (e.g. universities, institutes, climate and meteorological services).
- (framework-term-prioritygroup)=
  **Priority groups**: Representatives from vulnerable or marginalized groups, exposed areas, or other relevant communities in society.
- (framework-term-user)=
  **Users** are directly related to the (technical) use of the CLIMAAX Climate Risk Assessment Framework and risk workflows.


## Supporting Definitions

- (framework-term-adaptivecapacity)=
  **Adaptive Capacity** is "[t]he ability of systems, institutions, humans and other organisms to adjust to potential damage, to take advantage of opportunities or to respond to consequences" (MEA, 2005).
- (framework-term-crm)=
  **Climate Risk Management (CRM)** includes plans, actions, strategies or policies that “reduce the likelihood and/or magnitude of adverse potential consequences, based on assessed or perceived risk” (IPCC, 2023, p. 2921). CRM has the goal of reaching resilience and adaptation. 
- (framework-term-riskoutcome)=
  **Risk Outcome** is the quantitative result(s) of the Risk Workflow(s) as part of Risk Analysis and feeds into the Key Risk Assessment for their contextualisation and evaluation.

Further supporting definitions will be continuously added according to the need of (pilot) regions and applicant communities.

## Conceptual Background

A CRA needs to stand on solid ground, targeting and enabling success factors, while simultaneously providing operational steps for practical implementation. The conceptual background of the CLIMAAX Framework is organized around a three-pronged design:

1. [**Principles**](principles) – a collection of principles, norms, and recommended practices that forms a grassroot, community-based standard on how climate risk assessment can facilitate {abbr}`transformative adaptation (Transformative Adaptation stands in contrast to incremental adaptation and is defined as "adapting to climate change resulting in significant changes in structure or function that go beyond adjusting existing practices including approaches that enable new ways of decision making on adaptation" (IPCC, 2022, p. 164). In its specific objective 2 the EU Mission Adaptation (European Commission, 2021) aims at accelerating transformative adaptation, resilience and solutions.)`.
2. [**Technical choices**](technical_choices) – clear technical specification of considerations needed for conducting a CRA such as selection of scenarios, use and selection of local data, timeframe, spatial scale.
3. [**Participatory processes**](participatory_processes) – approaches for implementing an inclusive CRA which support local and regional communities in identifying shared goals and priorities for coordinated CRM efforts.
