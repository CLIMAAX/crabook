# Conceptual Background

A CRA needs to stand on solid ground, targeting and enabling success factors, while simultaneously providing operational steps for practical implementation. The conceptual background of the CLIMAAX Framework is organized around a three-pronged design:

1. **Principles** – a collection of principles, norms, and recommended practices that forms a grassroot, community-based standard on how climate risk assessment can facilitate {abbr}`transformative adaptation (Transformative Adaptation stands in contrast to incremental adaptation and is defined as "adapting to climate change resulting in significant changes in structure or function that go beyond adjusting existing practices including approaches that enable new ways of decision making on adaptation" (IPCC, 2022, p. 164). In its specific objective 2 the EU Mission Adaptation (European Commission, 2021) aims at accelerating transformative adaptation, resilience and solutions.)`.
2. **Technical choices** – clear technical specification of considerations needed for conducting a CRA such as selection of scenarios, use and selection of local data, timeframe, spatial scale.
3. **Participatory processes** – approaches for implementing an inclusive CRA which support local and regional communities in identifying shared goals and priorities for coordinated CRM efforts.
