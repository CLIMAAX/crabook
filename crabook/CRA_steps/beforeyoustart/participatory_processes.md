# Participatory processes

Participatory processes are fundamental for the assessment of vulnerability and are thus located at the very heart of the CLIMAAX Framework. They allow for inclusion of multiple bottom-up aspects that are relevant to undertake a comprehensive CRA. An inclusive approach is thus essential to develop relevant plans and strategies.

Regions should engage with [stakeholders](#framework-term-stakeholder) from policy or relevant public and private sectors, [experts](#framework-term-expert) (scientists, practitioners or policy advisors with robust knowledge) or [priority groups](#framework-term-prioritygroup)  (representatives from vulnerable or marginalized groups and exposed areas) by organising in-person group workshops, group meetings, discussion rounds or other types of meetings and interactions that a region considers beneficial. Further inclusion of local knowledge may be facilitated through participatory GIS mapping or "triangulation", which aims at combining methods and different sources of knowledge.

To avoid or overcome stakeholder fatigue, it is important to facilitate a targeted outreach, emphasize mutual benefits, and navigate diverse opinions to achieve meaningful consensus. Increasingly complex climate risk and interplay with socio-economic vulnerabilities and exposure demands a more integrated approach to climate risk management. This includes a comprehensive treatment of justice and inclusive governance structures and decision-making.

Exchange is encouraged throughout the CRA process with relevant stakeholders, experts and priority groups by engaging in **bidirectional learning**, **communication** and **consultation**. While it is widely accepted that the inclusion of multiple perspectives, such as the local context and knowledge, are beneficial for an extensive CRA, this is indeed a challenge in practice.

Stakeholder and citizen engagement can be facilitated through many options. The [DIY Manual provided by Climate Adapt](https://climate-adapt.eea.europa.eu/en/mission/solutions/citizen-engagement-manual?activeAccordion=e87d5052-caba-474b-8933-72c5ab68603e) provides valuable information and guidance for diving into stakeholder analysis, climate change communication or other approaches.
