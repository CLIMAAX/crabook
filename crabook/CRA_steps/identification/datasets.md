Datasets
=======================

Climate risk assessments (CRA) combine datasets on [hazards](hazard_data), [exposure](exposure_data) and [vulnerability](vulnerability_data), both under current as well as future climatic and socioeconomic conditions. Here we provide details of different pan-European datasets that can form the basis of {abbr}`CRA (Climate Risk Assessment)`, all of which are publicly available under an open-access license. These examples of hazard, exposure, and vulnerability datasets provide an overview of data currently used in {abbr}`CRA (Climate Risk Assessment)` or for potential use in {abbr}`CRA (Climate Risk Assessment)`.  

As we are still in the process of identifying datasets, these sections will be continuously updated.
